# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis is to aid the manufacturing team of AutosRU by evaluating the following:
  - How do various attributes of a vehicle contribute to mpg?
  - Caluculate the summary statistics for the PSI of the suspension coils.
  - Statistically compare the manufacturing lots to the mean population
  - Design a study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar against vehicles from other manufacturers.

## Results
  ### Linear Regression to Predice MPG

  - Vehicle Weight and Ground Clearance are the least likely to contribute a random amount of variance to thempg values.
  - The slope is non-zero because the contributing factors (Vehicle Weight and Ground Clearance) have non-zero coefficients (6.267 and 3.546, respectively)
  - This model accounts for roughly 70% of the variability in the data according to the Multiple R-sqaured value of 0.7149
