# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis is to aid the manufacturing team of AutosRU by evaluating the following:
  - How do various attributes of a vehicle contribute to mpg?
  - Caluculate the summary statistics for the PSI of the suspension coils.
  - Statistically compare the manufacturing lots to the mean population
  - Design a study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar against vehicles from other manufacturers.

## Results
  ### Linear Regression to Predice MPG

  - Vehicle Weight and Ground Clearance are the least likely to contribute a random amount of variance to thempg values.
  - The slope is non-zero because the contributing factors (Vehicle Weight and Ground Clearance) have non-zero coefficients (6.267 and 3.546, respectively)
  - This model accounts for roughly 70% of the variability in the data according to the Multiple R-sqaured value of 0.7149

  As evidenced by the statistical summaries above, the overal production between the plants is within the MechaCar specification of variance less than 100 psi. With additional drilling down, it is shown that lot 3 is NOT within this tolerance. Additional investigation should focus on the process at manufacturing lot 3.
